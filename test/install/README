The gribLoader Install Test Suite
=========================

This document describes how to run regression tests for the gribLoader program.


Overview
--------

There are several tests for the gribLoad program. Each outputs a single line of 
TAP formatted output, plus possibly comments. see 
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Harness/lib/Test/Harness/TAP.pod for a quick 
primer on this protocol.


Runnable Programs
-----------------

<todo>
testGribLoad.t 
  This runs all the tests, matching the pattern *.test. The output is formatted
  for the TAP protocol, and therefore you may use the program as argument to 
  the program *prove*.
</todo>

caseXXXX.test
  This runs test case XXXX.


Other files
-----------

caseXXXX.grib
  An input GRIB file for test case XXXX.

caseXXXX.resultX
  A result file for test case XXXX which output from the test case may be compared with to verify the correctness of results.


Generated files
---------------

/tmp/caseXXXX.log
  The log output from running test case XXXX.
